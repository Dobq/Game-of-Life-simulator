----INSTRUCTIONS----

----COMMENTS----

This program is final project for one of my university python courses; created months before uploading to GitHub.

Before uploading I added english in-code comments (so now they are bilingual; whole code probably is overcommented) and did few cosmetic changes.

Before running the code make sure that .py file is in a folder where it is fine if it create dozens or hundreds of graphics.
